# tuny-custom
* A business website, developed with React, for a custom t-shirt store. <br />
* ~~Tuny Custom T-shirts: https://334tuny.com/~~ (*my ex-boss has decided to move on with different website as of September 2020*). <br />
* However, the original web app, built during 2019, is still viewable on my Github page: https://slowreactiontime.github.io/tuny-custom/

# What I Learned
* Implemented some functionalities and organization using React Bootsrap.
* Developed navigation within the website using react-router-dom.
* Customized appearance using styled-components.
* Published the website on Netliify using netlify-cli.
* Published the project using gh-pages at my Github page.
* Had a domain from GoDaddy to point at my project on Netlify.
